I am broadly interested in the intersection of physics and computation. My primary focus lies in quantum
physics and non-Hermitian photonics, with an emphasis on understanding fundamental physical principles through
simulation and modeling. Leveraging my dual background in Engineering Physics and Electrical & Computer Engineering,
I am also interested in developing and applying artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to accelerate
scientific discovery, such as enhancing physical simulations, analyzing complex experimental data, and bridging
theoretical models with experimental observables.
