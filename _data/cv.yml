- title: Research Interests
  type: list
  contents:
    - "I am broadly interested in the intersection of physics and computation. My primary focus lies in quantum physics and non-Hermitian photonics, with an emphasis on understanding fundamental physical principles through simulation and modeling. Leveraging my dual background in Engineering Physics and Electrical & Computer Engineering, I am also interested in developing and applying artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to accelerate scientific discovery, such as enhancing physical simulations, analyzing complex experimental data, and bridging theoretical models with experimental observables."

        - title: Equating the Biologically Effective Dose of SBRT and 90Y SIRT
          contents:
            - Built a voxel-level pipeline aligning DGAE-MRI k1(x) maps to CT-based dosimetry; defined parenchyma masks and dose binning to quantify %Δk1 post-therapy.
            - Harmonized modalities onto a common biological scale using LQ-based EQD2 for SBRT and protraction-aware BED (Lea–Catcheside kernel) for SIRT.
            - Modeled subvoxel SIRT nonuniformity via EUD and fit mixed-effects 4-parameter logistic dose–response with covariates; calibrated repair rate μ and micro-dose CV c by aligning SBRT/SIRT curves with bootstrap uncertainty.
        - title: ReMasker-Cox — Survival-Guided Masked Autoencoder for Missing Data Imputation
          contents:
            - Extended a masked autoencoder (ReMasker) to jointly optimize imputation and survival consistency by adding a CoxPH loss (PyCox) to the reconstruction objective.
            - Implemented a training workflow with random masking, joint loss weighting, and evaluation focused on preserving risk structure for clinical tabular data.
